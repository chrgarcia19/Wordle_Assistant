# Wordle_Assistant
This is a basic, bare bones command line program that assists a user with the daily Wordle from the New York Times website. The program goes through a master list of words taken from the game's source code and narrows down the list based on your guesses. 

## What's the Purpose?
This simple program is meant to be used as a resource on your daily Wordle game. The main idea is for this program to help you make super educated guesses on the daily Wordle without getting the word explicitly given to you.
