# Wordle_Assistant
This is a program written in Python3 which assists a user with the daily Wordle from the New York Times (https://www.nytimes.com/games
wordle/index.html). The program goes through a master list of 5 letter words, which are contained in wordlewords.txt, and narrows down the
possible list of words that could be the correct word of the day. This is still a work in progress with functionality for Black and Green labelled words
working properly. Yellow labelled words require more testing. Words consisting of two of the same letter where one is in the correct place and the
other is not breaks the program.
